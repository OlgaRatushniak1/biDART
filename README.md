* Once upon a time a some molecules decided to actually move through space. 
* However, 
* they only moved through space with their fingers. 
* But with those fingers they typed without error,
* and more wickedly than ever before.
* With flaming eyes they saw in light,
* the symbols rain down the pixels at night!
* With sweat dripping,
* late night coffee sipping,
* they realized...
* Never has such wicked typing been witnessed,
* by...sheep? (what) 
* Let us not derail! 
* Cough! And from these movements a program was formed... 

* Binary Intruder's NPPO's(Non Profit Profit Organization's) Video Game Rental System was now part of our existence.
* Welcome, "biDART".

- "Hello world." said biDART.

* And so the tale carried on...
