* Once upon a time a some molecules decided to actually move through space. 
* However! 
* They only moved through space with their fingers. 
* But with those fingers they typed without error,
* and more wickedly than ever before!
* With flaming eyes they saw in light,
* the symbols rain down the pixels at night.
* With sweat dripping,
* late night coffee sipping,
* they realised...
* Never has such wicked typing been witnessed,
* by...sheep? (what) 
* Let us not derail! 
* Erhm! And from these movements a program was formed... 

* Binary Intruder's NPPO's(Non Profit Profit Orginisation's) Video Game Rental System was now part of our existance.
* Welcome, "biDART".

- "Hello" Said biDart.

And so the tale carried on...
