* Once upon a time a little group of molecules decided to actually move through space. 
* However, 
* they only moved through space with their fingers. 
* But with those fingers they typed, 
* more wickedly than ever before!
* Never has such wicked typing been witnessed,
* by...sheep? 
* And! from these movements, 
* a program was formed... 

* Binary Intruders NPO's Video Game Rental System was now part of our existance.
* Welcome, "biDART".
