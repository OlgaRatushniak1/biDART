* Once upon a time a little group of molecules decided to actually move through space. 
* However, 
* they only moved through space with their fingers. 
* But with those fingers they typed without error,
* and more wickedly than ever before!
* With flaming eyes they saw,
* The symbols rain down the pixels on their screens.
* With sweat running down their foreheads,
* They realised...
* Never has such wicked typing been witnessed,
* by...sheep? 
* And! from these movements a program was formed... 

* Binary Intruders NPPO's(Non Profit Profit Orginisation's) Video Game Rental System was now part of our existance.
* Welcome, "biDART".
